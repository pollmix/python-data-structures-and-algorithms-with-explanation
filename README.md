## What is Data Structure?
Data structures are some ways of organizing data so that data can be used efficiently.

## Why learn Data Structure and Algorithms?
Mostly to understand how data is treated in real world. 
It's a fundamental topic for those who wants to step into computer science and also in fortune companies.

## What is algorithm complexity?
Algorithm complexity means how much resouce it's take to perform the task.
There are two types of complexity- 
- Time complexity: How much time needed to complete the program
- Space complexity: How much memory or space needed to complete the program

## Stack
It is just like a pile of plates kept on top of each other.

Think about the things you can do with such a pile of plates

- Put a new plate on top
- Remove the top plate

If you want the plate at the bottom, you have to first remove all the plates on top. 
Such an arrangement is called **Last In First Out (LIFO)** - the last item that was placed is the first item to go out.
